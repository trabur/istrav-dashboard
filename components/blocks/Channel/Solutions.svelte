			<br />
			<div class="desc">Items that arive on a pallet need to be taken off the stack and put on a cart (for a waist height working surface). Sometimes an item may need to be assembled such as a water bottle; for example: take cap out of bag, put staw in bottle, screw cap on. Once items are put together and ready then fulfillment may start accepting carts stacked full of items.</div>

			<br />
			<div class="desc">When a cart rolls in we grad each kit's item(s) and put it into packaging for shipping. Boxes that show up unassembled will need to be folded and taped together. For a single item kit bulk order such as a book ... it may just go in a padded envelope. For 5 item kits (such as: bottle, visor, card, etc.) they may all go into a sizable box.</div>
